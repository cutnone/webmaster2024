        <h3>Hydroelectric Energy</h3>
        <p>Hydroelectric power on a smaller scale, in households and communities, 
            allows for sustainable electricity generation while avoiding the social 
            and environmental harm that can be caused by large dams. Additionally, 
            household hydroelectric generators can utilize creeks or rivers near the
            property to constantly generate electricity.
